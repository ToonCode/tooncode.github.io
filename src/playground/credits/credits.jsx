            <p>
                More than 100 people have helped translate TurboWarp and its addons into many languages —
                far more than we could hope to list here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately due to PenguinMod's small size, we have decided to mainly focus on English.
                You can still use PenguinMod with the other languages, but they will not be updated at this time.
